1 – You have methods with return types that do not return anything and should not work.  For example, isEven says it will
return a boolean and yet it never returns anything.  It just prints out a message.  Not a good practice.  Let the method that calls it do the
printing out.  In isPrime you mix and match with YEsy and No and true and false.  Be consistent.

2 – You do not setup instance methods in your .h file, just variables.  Does this even run for you?  I do not know how.  
You appear to be missing some important concepts about classes and how they are setup in Objective-C.

3 – In your isPerfectSquare method you really should stop checking and exit the method as soon as you determine that it is a perfect square.

4 – The nearest perfect square method only looks for numbers below the given value.  Couldn't there be a close perfect square greater 
than the number.
